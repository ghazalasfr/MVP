Online learning website for my students

the main goal is to create a website for my students to help them in their studies i prefer to work alone on it and do all the work by myself
Technologies
https://ghazallelasfar.wixsite.com/collegeducation
i will use all what we learnt in alx program as technologies
Challenge
time and technologies problems , i am afraid that i don’t have much time specially
that i am working alone on it but we learnt how to manage time in this program
and i will do it be side time , there is also the challenge of not having much experiences on
developing that kind of app and i need more studies about it
about the most difficult technical challengers are
Scalable Architecture: Designing an architecture capable of scaling
horizontally to handle increasing loads was crucial. This involved utilizing
technologies like WebSockets for real-time communication and deploying the
application on a cloud infrastructure that supports auto-scaling based on
demand.
Optimized Data Storage: Efficiently storing and retrieving messages in a way
that facilitates fast retrieval and minimizes latency was a significant concern.
Implementing a distributed database or utilizing caching mechanisms can help
optimize data access.
Message Queuing: Introducing message queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ can
help decouple the sending and receiving of messages, ensuring reliability and
scalability. This also enables asynchronous processing, reducing the
response time for users.
Load Balancing and Failover: Implementing robust load balancing
mechanisms and failover strategies is essential to ensure continuous service
availability, even during peak usage or in the event of server failures.
Security: Implementing end-to-end encryption and robust authentication
mechanisms to ensure the privacy and security of user messages is
paramount.
Risks
there is mush online learning website so i need to create one of the best for
students if i want to make it successful
Infrastructure
● collect information
● choose tools
● create static pages
● create dynamic pages
● create serveurs

● tests
Existing Solutions
of course there are many solutions as Online learning website
exemples : udemy , coursera, khan academy ..
Project Updates
I am working right now on collection information and making the architect of the
website
Progress
On a scale of 1 to 10, I can rate the progress that I made this week about 6 because i
faced a lot of challengers that i should work on it
there is a part of work that i found difficult to make it works but i looking for the best
options to make it works
i have problem with database so i have to find the solution
